# ROS2 Evaluation

## Introduction

The project provides a benchmarking environment and nodes implementation for testing and evaluation of ROS2, also with comparison to ROS1 and OpenSplice DDS implementation.

The ROS2 evaluation is a part of PIAP tasks in R5-Cop project (http://r5-cop.eu/en/). We aim to create an independent assessment of the current ROS2 state in terms of whether it looks promising, shows some gains on ROS1 already, whether it will be worth migrating to anytime soon, etc.

The project has additional value of providing an example implementation of a simple communication layer based on ROS2 (there is some architecture to it that might fit into some applications, not just a simple main.cpp stuff). The ros2node library might be an useful tool to anyone wanting to implement ROS2 for their robotic applications.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```
    apt-get install python3-docker docker.io tcpdump gnuplot # ubuntu
    pacman -S python-docker-py docker tcpdump gnuplot        # arch
```

2. Add your user to the docker group.

3. Build all containers (2h+):

```
    ./python/run.py --build-all
```

4. Get more help on running tests:

```
    ./python/run.py --help
```
